exported (usually directly to engine) by cramming grayscale baked maps into

used and by extension the memory footprint. This is meant to be a simple
alternative to pit-stopping over to compositing software to finish the job
but its usability is limited.

Map Packing in GrabDoc is new, so here's a few things to keep note of:
\u2022 Only grayscale maps can currently be packed
\u2022 Map packing isn't supported for Marmoset bakes
\u2022 Any successfully packed maps will not also be exported as their
own maps and will also ignore `Import as Material` option
\u2022 The default selected packed channels don't represent the default enabled
bake maps, meaning without intervention G, B, and A channels will be empty."""

\u2022 Pressing OK will dismiss this warning permanently for the project."""
